## üí° Recommendation

For the best protection against modern cheat clients, it is **strongly recommended** to run **DuckyAC alongside [Vulcan](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vulcan-anti-cheat-advanced-cheat-detection-1-8-1-21-5.83626/)** and **[GrimAC](https://modrinth.com/plugin/lightning-grim-anticheat)**.  
Each plugin covers different types of exploits, and together they form a powerful defense.
